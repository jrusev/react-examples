# React Examples

Here are some small React demos written with JSX. You can also put the JSX code in a separate file and transform it from the command line, then reference the plain js file in the html (so no need to include the JSXTransformer.js to transform in the browswer). See [Getting Started](http://facebook.github.io/react/docs/getting-started.html).
